GIT

Version Control
	Version control looks like adding complicated stuff on top of 
already complicated coding work.
	Record the changes in the code over the time period
	It will update the changes in the code in the repository 
	The history of the changes made can be known
	Helps to Track history and Work together
VCs types
	Centralized VCs
		All ur team members get the code through the centralized 
machine, if any changes made required in the sense they will change.
		Single point so easily get failed
	Distributed VCs	
		Each member in the project has its own copy of project
in their machine, once when centralized system is applied we can share 
our modified content to others. Eg:- GIT

Two types of repository
Local Repository => you machine with your working software(PC)
Remote Repository => common server/hub

Stagged area is having the list of files in the particular folder and 
whenever the work is done it push them into working directory or local 
directory
